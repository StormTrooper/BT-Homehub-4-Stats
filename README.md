BT-Homehub-4-Stats
==================

Perl script to pull the ip info, connection speed and bandwidth from the BT Home Hub 4

This perl script is used to pull the stats from a BT Home Hub 4 and dumps them to a csv file.
Usage: ./adsl_stats.pl password filename

The script is a hack of a script I found for the BT Home Hub 3 which can be downloaded from here
http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/disk1/disk1/download.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/b/bt/bthubstats/


No more development is being done on the scripts so had to do a bit of hacking to get it working on the BT Home Hub 4.
I haven't been abble to get the attenuation/noise/power etc stats as it looks like these were removed.
